        </h1>

        As a product team, how do you know which problem to solve? This question might be hard to answer, especially if you don’t understand your customers behaviors, needs and goals. Thankfully, a series of pertinent questions during a user interview can help you generate a map of the most frequent and intense problems in your user’s life.

        To understand a problem, you want to know how it makes a user suffer and to what extent. After hearing a user qualify something as a problem, you can ask several clarifying questions such as:

        “Why was this a problem for you?”

        Users feel pain in several ways such as time lost, emotional frustration or physical injury. Finding the type of pain is the first thing you should focus on as you start uncovering negative topics in your conversations with users. If you can qualify the pain, you will then be able to measure how painful it is to your user.
